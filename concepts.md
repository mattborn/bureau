# Concepts

1. None of this is fact.
2. Most of it is personal opinion.
3. Much of it is borrowed.
4. All of it is an educated guess.

## Interdependent Principles
**each is enforced by the others**

### Conway’s law (homomorphism)

1. “organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations” — Melvin Conway, 1968
2. [Code Hale explains it very well.](http://www.livestream.com/etsy/video?clipId=pla_780bfe22-12e8-4c7f-8c7b-06cc6cac9c49)
3. Resolution? Use iterative processes.

### Parkinson’s law

1. “work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion”
2. Heart proximity of process + progress.
2. Heart tight feedback loops.
2. Heart self-imposed deadlines (time blocks).
3. Stock–Sanford corollary: “If you wait until the last minute, it only takes a minute to do.”

### Sturgeon’s law

1. “ninety percent of everything is crap” — Theodore Sturgeon
2. This is especially true for the internet + productivity philosophy.
3. Embrace your convictions.
4. Also, “it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.” — Aristotle

## Dichotomous Paradigms
*involving two competing ideals*

### Document vs. application

1. The internet started out as a series of + is still mostly comprised of documents.
2. Support for modern web applications is a second class citizen in all web language specifications.
3. HTML5 tags are not necessary for applications.
4. The cascading in CSS works best for documents.

### Generic vs. proprietary

1. Generic interfaces are things users are already familiar with. (menus, forms, and lists)
2. Proprietary interfaces are things you have to educate users about.
3. Invest your time in creating intuitive experiences for the proprietary.
4. Don’t reinvent the wheel for the generic.

### Separation of concerns vs. proper separation of concerns

1. I stole this phrase from [Tom Occhino](https://youtu.be/KVZ-P-ZI6W4?t=683).
2. By itself, separation of concerns is arbitrary.
3. A “proper” separation of concerns is effective both immediately + perpetually.
4. It takes time + gumption to determine whether something is perpetually effective.

### Mobile first vs. desktop first

1. Mobile first
2. Desktop first

### Content vs. composition

1. Content is king.
2. Composition steers the content.
3. Explore both simultaneously + pragmatically.

### Creativity vs. talent

1. All people are creative.
2. Some people are talented.
3. We are all creative because we all have free will which includes the ability to solve problems in a unique way.
4. Some people are born with a propensity towards sharpening certain skills faster than others.
5. Nobody becomes great at anything without practice.

### Art vs. design

1. Art is subject to interpretation.
2. Design shouldn’t be.

### Design vs. graphic design

1. Design can be anything including how you live your life, which tools you include in your workflow, and your database schema.
2. Graphic design is the specific discipline of creating visual assets according to the limitations of a certain medium. (print mediums are paper + other textiles, digital mediums are devices with screens)

### UX vs. UI

1. User experience is a descriptor for articulating desired thoughts + behaviors to accomplish a specific outcome.
2. User interface is the means by which a human is able to interact with the function of an application. (this could be digital or physical like keys on a keyboard)
3. You cannot create a user interface without first understanding what is required for the user experience.
